    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>I do <strong>not</strong> own nor do I claim to own any of the recipes presented on this website. The
        construction of this webpage
        is purely for experiecne and understading. With this being said I have linked the where I found these recipes
        from under each photo in the respective page. You might notice that there is not a link for the ramen recipe,
        that is because I wrote that one myself due to the fact that as of right now I myself am a poor college student
        who sadly has to eat ramen more than anyone should ever.</p>
