            and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make Crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until
            well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough
